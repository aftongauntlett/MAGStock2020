						Response to COVID-19:</p>
					<p style="font-size: 15px">MAGFest, Inc. is an events-based company, and so it's natural for there
						to be serious and warranted concern regarding our events with respect to the COVID-19
						pandemic.<br> Due to the closure of all privately-owned campgrounds that was announced on Monday
						March 30 in the state of Virginia, we will be postponing MAGStock until August 2020 or later.
						We're in active communication with our longtime host, Small Country Campground, and will be
						sharing updates here when we have them. The health and safety of our community is our priority
						and we will continue to follow local government and CDC guidance. For our full statement on
						COVID-19 and for news on our other events, please visit<a
							href="https://super.magfest.org"></a>.<br> We're deeply saddened that so many really great
						events by our dear friends in the video game convention community and other adjacent communities
						have had to be cancelled or postponed this year. We also know that gatherings like these meet a
						deeply human need for connection, celebration, innovation, and levity--one that we're all
						missing keenly in this time of social distancing. We encourage you to support your other
						favorite events financially if you have the ability, and in the meantime, we'll do everything in
						our power to plan the best music and gaming festivals yet, so that we can all come out on the
						other side of this difficult time stronger together.<br> Stay tuned for more information as we
						have it, and please do your part to stop the spread. For more information about COVID-19, please
						refer to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/"></a>.
						Stay safe, and continue being excellent to each other! <br> ❤️ MAGStock. </p>

				<ol>
					<li class="rules-li">We decide the camping spots. We’re trying to keep track of where people are to
						help people find each other. So, don’t move or spread into your neighbor’s area unless you get
						permission from both them and us.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">Pets are welcome, but we strictly apply the “no bark – no bite” policy, a leash
						policy and clean up after pet rules.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">The campground quiet hours are from 11 pm to 8 am. Please keep noise down
						during this time.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">We’re all crammed together pretty tight. Be considerate to others. Don’t beg or
						steal. If your neighbor asks you to keep it down, try to do so. Don’t harass others at the
						campground.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">Fire safety is a must. No unattended fires! Fires must be in a fire ring or
						pit. If there is not a fire ring or pit, find one! No setting random things on fire.</li>

						don’t expect/steal provisions. Do not sell food outright.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">Drinking (if you’re of age) is fine. Don’t drink to the point of belligerence
						or fall-down drunk. If you reach this point, we’ll ask you to go to your tent to sleep it off.
						Don’t puke on the moon bounce.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">No alcohol is permitted at or on the lake.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">Dispose of your trash. We’re not your parents! We don’t want to ask you to
						clean up after yourself.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">Stay hydrated! Heatstroke will not be noticed until it is too late. CONSTANTLY.
						DRINK. WATER.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">If you brought stuff to sell, don’t be pushy or shady about it. Contact us at
						<a href="mailto:admin@magstock.org">admin@magstock.org</a> so we can assess the situation and
						help you. Items that will not be acceptable for sale include, but are not limited to: alcohol,
						drugs, and fireworks.</li>

					<li class="rules-li">No vandalizing the campground or anyone else’s belongings.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">Wear your wristband at all times.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">Checkout time is 12:00 PM Sunday – this is when your gear should be mostly
						packed and your campsite cleaned up. Feel free to stick around for longer to help out or get
						some last-minute hangs though!</li>
					<li class="rules-li">Children under 18 must be at their campsite and under a parent’s supervision
						after 11pm.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">The campground does not allow the use of any fireworks, please keep these at

						structures, inflatables, etc.) may not be disposed of at the campground and must be removed by
						the owner before leaving the campground.</li>

						change attire by a MAGStock staffer (wearing an orange MAGStock hat) or by the campground staff.

				<h2 class="major">FAQ</h2>

				<p>I want to make gobs of money, and sell things to unsuspecting campers!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We handle this on a case-by-case basis. Email us at <a
							href="mailto:admin@magstock.org">admin@magstock.org</a> and let us know what you are looking
						to do.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Quiet hours? What is this?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Local noise ordinances mean we cannot play amplified music after 11pm. Please do not play
						amplified music between the hours of 11pm and 8am.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>How are we going to play games at a campground? Is there going to be any power?
					<ul>
						<li>The campground has more power than the Hilton Mark Center. No, seriously. You will need to
							get creative so your things do not get wet.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Are there showers? Running water?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Most definitely yes, and if you don’t take a shower we are throwing you in the lake. There are
						showers in the bath house in the middle of the Black camping area, as well as next to the Manor
						House.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There’s a lake?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Yes, there most certainly is a lake.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Is there WiFi?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It’s slow, but it’s there. You may want to use cell phone internet, but even that’s a little
						iffy. You should be able to at least check your email and facebook!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Can I bring my dog?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pets are allowed and there is no charge. They must be kept on a leash at all times. The site has
						aggressive breed restrictions so please call them first. There’s a no barking and biting policy
						and a maximum of 3 pets allowed per campsite. Since we’re all going to be crammed together you
						may want to consider leaving your pet in the care of someone at home.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Can I bring my kids?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Kids under 5 are allowed and there is no charge. They must be kept under supervision at all
						times. There’s a no barking and biting policy and a maximum of 6 kids allowed per campsite.
						Since we’re all going to be crammed together you may want to consider leaving your kid in the
						care of someone at home.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Where am I going to get food?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Louisa is nearby and has some food places and you should certainly bring snacks and drinks for
						yourself and friends! We also sell a limited number of food passes for the weekend that get you
						3 meals a day cooked by our awesome staff.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Can I drink?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Alcohol consumption is allowed at the campground. You are not permitted to sell alcohol onsite.
						Enjoy responsibly! Keep in mind that it is a lot easier to get dehydrated while outdoors. All
						laws continue to apply. Alcohol is not permitted on the lake or the beach. If you leave a glass
						bottle on the beach we will find you. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>WHAT IS THIS MOON BOUNCE YOU SPEAK OF?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>They’ve got a moon bounce buried in the sand and it rules. Also a floating thing in the lake.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>ARE YOU SERIOUS!?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>YES WE ARE!</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<br>
				<pr>This sounds really awesome, but I have more questions. Ask us! <a
