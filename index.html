					community through online

					#magstock channel on

				<span class="image main"><img src="images/concert3.jpg" alt="concerts and lasers" /></span>
				<p style="font-weight: 600;">I Can See That You’re Only Interested in the Exceptionally Rare… </p>
				<p>Ah, good evening to you worthy friends. Please, please, come closer-there. Welcome to MAGStock; event
					of conviviality, of chillaxment...and the finest live music this side of the river Potomac!</p>

				<p style="font-weight: 600;">So, seriously, what IS MAGStock? </p>
				<p>MAGStock is what happens when MAGFest’s community of music and gaming nerds descend upon a campground
					for a weekend of live music, camping, crafts, good times, and general shenanigans. Think summer camp
					meets music festival in tents with that magical MAGFest atmosphere you know and love! </p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/concert.jpg" alt="concerts and lasers" /></span>
				<p style="font-weight: 600;">What is there to do at MAGStock? </p>
				<div class="aboutList">
					<p>Have you ever wandered past some strangers’ campsite and received an invite over for an impromptu
						Mario Party tournament projected onto a sheet hanging from two trees? Well, then you haven’t
						really lived, have you? But you can! You never know what you’ll get into at MAGStock; even we
						are surprised at the creativity and ingenuity of MAGStock attendees year after year.</p>

					<p>That being said, things you can likely expect include: </p>
					<li>Camping (like, in tents. Don’t worry, the sites have power. Scared ya for a bit, didn’t we?)
					</li>
					<li>Sun (hopefully, maybe… heavy rain is always a possibility, plan accordingly!) </li>
					<li>Swimming (there’s a pool and a lake - options!) </li>
					<li>Grilling (oh yeah, don’t forget to bring food; human beings require that to survive!) </li>
					<li>Video Game Music Concerts (need we say more?) </li>
					<li>Board Games/Tabletop Games </li>
					<li>Crafts/Tie-Dyeing </li>
					<li>Moon Bounce </li>
					<li>Mini Golf </li>
					<li>Good times, good friends, and soon-to-be good friends </li>
					</li>

				<p style="font-weight: 600;">Where is this elusive unicorn of an event?</p>
				<p>MAGStock is held at Small Country Campground in lovely, rural* Louisa, Virginia. Please do not
					attempt to make reservations through the campground, registering through us gets you access to
					MAGStock event spaces/activities and a spot to camp; reserving through the campground does NOT grant
					you access to MAGStock.</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;">Address:<br>
					4400 Byrd Mill Rd.<br>
					Louisa, VA 23093</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;">* when we say “rural”, we mean it. Good luck getting a cell signal.</p>

						don’t expect/steal provisions. Do not sell food outright.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">Drinking (if you’re of age) is fine. Don’t drink to the point of belligerence

						Don’t puke on the moon bounce.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">No alcohol is permitted at or on the lake.</li>

						DRINK. WATER.</li>
					<li class="rules-li">If you brought stuff to sell, don’t be pushy or shady about it. Contact us at

				<h2 class="major">FAQ</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/questions.jpg" alt="" /></span>

				<p>I want to make gobs of money, and sell things to unsuspecting campers!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We handle this on a case-by-case basis. Email us at <a
							href="mailto:admin@magstock.org">admin@magstock.org</a> and let us know what you are looking
						to do.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Quiet hours? What is this?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Local noise ordinances mean we cannot play amplified music after 11pm. Please do not play
						amplified music between the hours of 11pm and 8am.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>How are we going to play games at a campground? Is there going to be any power?
				<ul>
					<li>The campground has more power than the Hilton Mark Center. No, seriously. You will need to
						get creative so your things do not get wet.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Are there showers? Running water?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Most definitely yes, and if you don’t take a shower we are throwing you in the lake. There are
						showers in the bath house in the middle of the Black camping area, as well as next to the Manor
						House.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There’s a lake?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Yes, there most certainly is a lake.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Is there WiFi?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It’s slow, but it’s there. You may want to use cell phone internet, but even that’s a little
						iffy. You should be able to at least check your email and facebook!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Can I bring my dog?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pets are allowed and there is no charge. They must be kept on a leash at all times. The site has
						aggressive breed restrictions so please call them first. There’s a no barking and biting policy
						and a maximum of 3 pets allowed per campsite. Since we’re all going to be crammed together you
						may want to consider leaving your pet in the care of someone at home.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Can I bring my kids?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Kids under 5 are allowed and there is no charge. They must be kept under supervision at all
						times. There’s a no barking and biting policy and a maximum of 6 kids allowed per campsite.
						Since we’re all going to be crammed together you may want to consider leaving your kid in the
						care of someone at home.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Where am I going to get food?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Louisa is nearby and has some food places and you should certainly bring snacks and drinks for
						yourself and friends! We also sell a limited number of food passes for the weekend that get you
						3 meals a day cooked by our awesome staff.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Can I drink?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Alcohol consumption is allowed at the campground. You are not permitted to sell alcohol onsite.
						Enjoy responsibly! Keep in mind that it is a lot easier to get dehydrated while outdoors. All
						laws continue to apply. Alcohol is not permitted on the lake or the beach. If you leave a glass
						bottle on the beach we will find you. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>WHAT IS THIS MOON BOUNCE YOU SPEAK OF?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>They’ve got a moon bounce buried in the sand and it rules. Also a floating thing in the lake.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>ARE YOU SERIOUS!?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>YES WE ARE!</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Is there a map of the campground?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Yep, check it out right here.

				<h2 class="major" style="color: rgb(206, 80, 80);">MAGFest's Response <br> to COVID-19</h2>
				<p>MAGFest, Inc. is an events-based company, and so it's natural for there
					to be serious and warranted concern regarding our events with respect to the COVID-19
					pandemic.<br> Due to the closure of all privately-owned campgrounds that was announced on Monday
					March 30 in the state of Virginia, we will be postponing MAGStock until August 2020 or later.
					We're in active communication with our longtime host, Small Country Campground, and will be
					sharing updates here when we have them. The health and safety of our community is our priority
					and we will continue to follow local government and CDC guidance. For our full statement on
					COVID-19 and for news on our other events, please visit<a href="https://super.magfest.org"></a>.</p>

				<p>We're deeply saddened that so many really great
					events by our dear friends in the video game convention community and other adjacent communities
					have had to be cancelled or postponed this year. We also know that gatherings like these meet a
					deeply human need for connection, celebration, innovation, and levity--one that we're all
					missing keenly in this time of social distancing. We encourage you to support your other
					favorite events financially if you have the ability, and in the meantime, we'll do everything in
					our power to plan the best music and gaming festivals yet, so that we can all come out on the
					other side of this difficult time stronger together.</p>
				<p>Stay tuned for more information as we have it, and please do your part to stop the spread. For more
					information about COVID-19, please
					refer to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/"></a>.</p>

				<p>Stay safe, and continue being excellent to each other!</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;">❤️ MAGStock. </p>
